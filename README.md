Red Wine Quality Analysis

Overview
This repository provides an in-depth analysis of the Red Wine Quality dataset. The goal is to understand the factors influencing wine quality and build predictive models to classify wine based on its physicochemical attributes.

Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
License: Freely available for research purposes
Format: CSV file with 1,599 samples and 12 features

Project Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset.
Apply data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.
Develop machine learning models to predict wine quality with MLflow used for model tracking and performance evaluation.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, etc.).
